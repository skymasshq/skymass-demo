[SkyMass](https://skymass.dev) is a Cloud UI Server.  It replaces the entire frontend stack to let you build high quality internal tools and modern business apps by simply writing a backend.

This repository contains examples that showcase SkyMass's features and interact with other popular services and libraries.
